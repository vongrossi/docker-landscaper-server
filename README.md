# Ubuntu LandScape Docker Container

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vongrossi/docker-landscaper-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vongrossi/docker-landscaper-server)


This container runs the Ubuntu landscape server components

#Requirements

- Landscape requires a postgres 9.3/9.4 server with plpython and the debversion modules installed
- A rabbitmq server is also required as the message bus between the various components

#TLS

There is a placeholer certificate in the files/certs directory which gets added to the container and used by apache for the SSL endpoint.

This has a common name of 'landscape-server'.
This should be replaced with a valid certificate and key

#Running locally

There is a docker compose file which will bring up a landscape server,
this will bring up the landscape server on port 80/443 on your docker host
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

It does the following:
## Postgres database server
Create a postgres container based off of the official 9.4 version with plpython and debversion installed

```
docker build -t postgres .
docker run -d --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password postgres
```

## Rabbitmq server
Create a rabbitmq container that will be linked in, which has the management module enables so you can 
access it via a web console

```
docker run -d --name rabbitmq -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management
```

## Landscape container creation
Then it build the landscape container, this container is based on ubuntu:14.04, this will link the postgres container into the landscape container and use that, if you have an external postgres instance you would just set the variables that are required

```
docker build -t landscape-server
docker run -d --link postgres:postgres --link rabbitmq:rabbitmq -e INITIALIZE_SCHEMA=yes -e DB_USER=postgres -e DB_PASS=password -e DB_LANDSCAPE_PASS=password -p 80:80 -p 443:443 landscape-server
```

### Valid commands for the landscape container
- app:schema - This will create the landscape user and schema but not start the application
